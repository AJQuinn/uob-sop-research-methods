# Week 9 : One Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) {.unnumbered}

This week we will explore how to run ANOVA analyses to compare means between two or more groups. This is an important analysis as many experimental and scientific contexts cannot be simiplified down to two groups for a t-test, and running many t-tests would increase our chances of false positive findings..

# Content Info

This is the same dataset that we used in week 7.

# Content Info

This tutorial refers to a video in which participants watched unpleasant events to simulate a traumatic experience in the lab. The content of this video is not disclosed or dicussed in any more detail than this during this tutorial - those who are interested can find more information in methods section the published article. This tutorial does explore the emotional impact that the video has on participants.

:::

## 1. The Dataset {.unnumbered}

Flashbacks and intrusive thoughts are a core features of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These can be highly distressing and disruptive for the person suffering from them and there are few early interventions that are known to help.

One unexpected and intriguing proposal in the last few decades suggests that carrying out very engaging visuo-spatial tasks with a neutral emotion in the immediate aftermath of a traumatic event may help reduce later flashbacks [@Holmes2009_CanPlaying]. This is thought to be due to intense visuo-spatial processing disrupting the formations of the flashback memories, which are themselves flashbacks. 

This week, we’re going to look at the dataset from one experiment attempting a replication and extension of this effect [@James2015_ComputerGame]. The abstract of the paper is below 

> Memory of a traumatic event becomes consolidated within hours. Intrusive memories can then flash back repeatedly into the mind’s eye and cause distress. We investigated whether reconsolidation—the process during which memories become malleable when recalled—can be blocked using a cognitive task and whether such an approach can reduce these unbidden intrusions. We predicted that reconsolidation of a reactivated visual memory of experimental trauma could be disrupted by engaging in a visuospatial task that would compete for visual working memory resources. We showed that intrusive memories were virtually abolished by playing the computer game Tetris following a memory-reactivation task 24 hr after initial exposure to experimental trauma. Furthermore, both memory reactivation and playing Tetris were required to reduce subsequent intrusions (Experiment 2), consistent with reconsolidation-update mechanisms. A simple, noninvasive cognitive-task procedure administered after emotional memory has already consolidated (i.e., > 24 hours after exposure to experimental trauma) may prevent the recurrence of intrusive memories of those emotional events 

This experiment shows participants a 12-minute distressing film to simulate a traumatic event. Participants completed three sessions in the experiment day 0, day 1 and day 7. They also kept a diary recording their thoughts and memories about the film throughout the week. Participants viewed the film on day 0 and completed a range of experimental tasks on days 1 and 7.

Crucially, participants were allocated to one of four conditions in the time immediately following the video. One group played tetris as a distraction, a second group completed a reactivation task which was throught to help reduce the emotional response to the video, a third group did both tetris and reconsolidation and a fourth group was a no-task control group.



## 2. The Challenge {.unnumbered}

This week - we will explore two of the four conditions to test the following hypothesis:

> Engaging in computer game and reactivation tasks after a trumatic event will reduce number of subsequent intrusive memories 

This is similar to the hypothesis from week 7, but now we have allowed for several conditions in the experiment rather than just two.

If we find evidence for a difference in our omnibus ANOVA test we can explore post-hoc comparisons to describe the exact difference that is present.

## 3. Analysis of Variance in Jamovi {.unnumbered}

At this point - you can probably figure out how to run the basics of an ANOVA analysis in Jamovi. There are a lot of similarities with the t-test analyses we have run.

To run the ANOVA, open the ANOVA -> ANOVA menu from the top ribbon.

::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple"}
# Jamovi Note!

Make sure you open the 'ANOVA' menu not the 'One-way ANOVA' menu. We will run a One-way ANOVA but will use the full ANOVA menu as it contains the full set of features and analyses that we will need. The One-way ANOVA menu is a streamlined option for very simple analyses.

:::

Once you have the menu open, click `Days_One_to_Seven_Image_Based_Intrusions_in_Intrusion_Diary` across to the Dependent Variable box and `Condition` across to the 'Fixed Factors'. The first ANOVA results table will appear in the results.

Very simple! but remember that it takes some additional work to check over and interpret the results from an ANOVA.

![](../images/rmb-week-9_computer-practical/rmb-week-9_computer-practical_img1.png)

Let's understand the results table in detail. First let's quickly review the theory:

In an ANOVA analysis we're comparing the sum-of-squared error between two different models - one model has all groups with the same mean and the second model gives each group its individual mean. From this we can compute three different sets of sum-sqaures.

![](../images/rmb-week-9_computer-practical/rmb-week-9_computer-practical_img-from-lecture.png)


- **Sum-Square Error Total** - the overall variability assuming that all groups have the same mean
- **Sum-Square Error Within** - the variability assuming that each group has its own mean
- **Sum-Square Error Between** - the change variability attributable to giving each group its own mean

The rationale is that if the groups have distinct means then **Sum-Square Within** will be much smaller than **Sum-Square Total**. This difference is quantified with **Sum-Square Between**.

These values are listed in the ANOVA table. The 'Sum of Squares' for Condition is the **Sum-Square Between** and the 'Sum of Squares' for Residuals is **Sum-Square Within**. (This terminology can get a little complex...).

The Sum-Square Error Between is `r fitb(115)` and the Sum-Square Error Within is `r fitb(686)`.

## Hint

![](../images/rmb-week-9_computer-practical/rmb-week-9_computer-practical_img1.png)

:::

:::

The next step is to compute the **Mean-Squares**. We need this additional step as the Sum-Squares will are senstive to the sample size and number of groups - we have to make a correction for this. The **Mean-Squares** are computed with two fractions.

$$
\text{Mean-Square Error Within} = \frac{\text{Sum-Square Error Within}}{\text{Number of Participants} - \text{Number of Groups}}
$$

$$
\text{Mean-Square Error Between} = \frac{\text{Sum-Square Error Between}}{\text{Number of Groups} - 1}
$$

The ingredients for these fractions are already in our ANOVA table. The top of the fraction is the Sum of Squares we've seen earlier. The values on the bottom of the fraction are actually precomputed for us as the Degrees of Freedom. 

The degrees of freedom for Condition (df between) is $\text{Number of Groups} - 1$. In our case we have four groups so the value is 3. The degrees of freedom for Residuals (df within) is $\text{Number of Participants} - \text{Number of Groups}$. We have 72 participants and 4 groups so the value is 68.

So, working across the ANOVA table in rows - we can see that the value of the Mean-Square Errors in third column is simply the first column divided by the second.

The Mean-Square Error Within is:

$\frac{\text{Sum-Square Error Within}}{\text{Number of Participants} - \text{Number of Groups}}$ = $\frac{\text{Sum-Square Error Between}}{\text{df within}}$ = $\frac{686}{68}$ = `r fitb(10.1)`

## 4. Effect size for ANOVA {.unnumbered}

There are several possible effect sizes we can use for ANOVA analyses. We will use $\eta^2$ (pronouced eta-squared) for one-way ANOVA. The Learning Statistics with Jamovi textbook has a nice summary of how to interpret $\eta^2$.

> The interpretation of $\eta^2$ is equally straightforward. It refers to the proportion of the variability in the outcome variable that can be explained in terms of the predictor. A value of 0 means that there is no relationship at all between the two, whereas a value of 1 means that the relationship is perfect. Better yet, the  value is very closely related to $R^2$ and has an equivalent interpretation
>
> - Slightly abridged quote from [Learning Statistics with Jamovi](https://davidfoxcroft.github.io/lsj-book/13-Comparing-several-means-one-way-ANOVA.html#effect-size)

Very straightforward indeed, we can think of $\eta^2$ as an $R^2$ for the ANOVA. It is also straightforward to compute - just check the box under 'Effect Sizes'.

![](../images/rmb-week-9_computer-practical/rmb-week-9_computer-practical_img2.png)

There are two other options for ANOVA effect sizes:

- partial $\eta^2$ will be useful for more complex ANOVA designs you will work with in other modules.
- $\omega^2$ is an unbiased estimator that could be used in place of $\eta^2$. Some sources recommend that we use $\omega^2$ rather than $\eta^2$ [@Albers2018_when]. You could use either and might encounter either in the literature.


## 5. Post-hoc Tests {.unnumbered}

An ANOVA analysis returns a significant effect that indicates that there is a difference between the group means but doesn't tell us anything about which groups are actually different. 

If, and only if, the overall ANOVA returns a significant result - we can use post-hoc tests to explore what the specific differences actually are. This is a critical step for the interpretation of our results. 

In the example above we saw that the experimental task that participants complete after watching the film does change the mean number of intrusive memories that the participants experience. The ANOVA table doesn't say more than this - as far as we know from this analysis it is possible that playing Tetris may have increased or decreased the number of intrusive memories.

Post-hoc tests are the answer for this - and post hoc tests are based on 'Estimated Marginal Means'. These sound more complex than they are. Estimated marginal means are adjusted means (and associated standard errors etc) that account for the assumptions of a statistical model and for the effects of any other variables in a model.

So, for an ANOVA the estimated means are adjusted for the assumption of **homogeneity of variance** - that each group has the same variance. We do not have any other variables to adjust for in this analysis but this is relevant for future Analysis of Co-Variance (ANCOVA) models that you may encounter in future modules.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
# Key step

Find the 'Estimated Marginal Means' drop down menu and add 'Condition' to the Terms box to compute the estimated marginal mean for each group within Condition. Make sure to include the plots and tables in the ouputs (though the x axis labels for this particular plot aren't very good...).

![](../images/rmb-week-9_computer-practical/rmb-week-9_computer-practical_img5.png)

:::

The table gives us our four marginal means summarising the mean of each group alongside a 95% confidence interval for that estimate and the Standard Error for each mean.



The chart gives us a more human readable summary of the means with the associated confidence intervals.

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - which conditions do you think are likely to be significantly different?

The `No-Task Control` and `Reactivation+Tetris` conditions have the largest difference in mean, with `Tetris Only` and `Reactivation Only` somewhere in between.

:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - why are the standard errors for each mean all the same?

Remember that these are the means computed **under the assumptions of the ANOVA**, not the normal means we see in the descriptive statistics.

This ANOVA assumes **homogeneity of variance** and the marginal mean can take this into account. If we computed the descriptive statistics the usual way we would see the individual estimate of the standard error for each group.

:::

So, lets run our post-hoc tests!

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
# Key step

Find the 'Post-Hoc Tests' drop down menu and add 'Condition' to the right hand box to compute the post hoc comparison between each pair of groups within Condition. 

Make sure to include 'Tukey' correction and add the Cohen's d effect size.

![](../images/rmb-week-9_computer-practical/rmb-week-9_computer-practical_img4.png)

:::

The Comparison columns lists the six pairwise comparisons that can be assembled from our four conditions. As before, the standard errors (SE column) are the same for all of the comparisons. Remember that these results are based on the estimated marginal means rather than the standard means we would use outside an ANOVA.

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - which comparisons show a significant difference?

The `No-Task Control` and `Reactivation+Tetris` conditions show a significant difference t(68) = 3.044, p-tukey = 0.017.

The `Reactivation+Tetris` and `Reactivation Only` conditions show a significant difference t(68) = -2.781, p-tukey = 0.034.

:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - which direction are the significant differences? ie which condition is larger?

We can use the estimated marginal means tables to be sure of these results.

The `No-Task Control` group (M=5.11) had more intrusive memories than the `Reactivation+Tetris` group (M=1.89). 

The `Reactivation+Tetris` group (M=1.89) had fewer intrusive memories than the `Reactivation Only` group (M=4.83).

:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - How do the results change if we use no correction to the p-values rather than Tukey correction?

You can add the uncorrected p-value to the output table in the Post Hoc tests menu.

The Tukey correction aims to account for the multiple comparisons that we are making. It **increases** the p-values to make it less likely that we would consider a difference to be significant.

Compare the `p` column with the `p-tukey` column. The uncorrected values are smaller - the `Reactivation+Tetris` to `Tetris Only` comparison is close to being significant in the uncorrected values.

## 6. Checking assumptions {.unnumbered}

As ever - the ANOVA makes certain assumptions about the data so that we can perform our statistics. These assumptions are similar to what we saw with t-tests and should all be in place for our ANOVA results to make a valid generalisation to the wide population.

## Questions

Match the ANOVA assumption to its definition.

| Assumption | Definition |
| -------|------------|
| Independence | `r mcq(c("Interval or Ratio data observations", "data must be reasonably normally distributed", "groups should each have equal variance", answer="data observations must be unrelated", "predicting factors must be divided into separate groups"))` |
| Normal distributions | `r mcq(c("Interval or Ratio data observations", answer = "data must be reasonably normally distributed", "groups should each have equal variance", answer="data observations must be unrelated", "predicting factors must be divided into separate groups"))` |
| Homogeneity of variance | `r mcq(c("Interval or Ratio data observations", answer = "data must be reasonably normally distributed", answer = "groups should each have equal variance", "data observations must be unrelated", "predicting factors must be divided into separate groups"))` |
| Categorical factors | `r mcq(c("Interval or Ratio data observations", answer = "data must be reasonably normally distributed",  "groups should each have equal variance", "data observations must be unrelated", answer = "predicting factors must be divided into separate groups"))` |
| Data type | `r mcq(c(answer = "Interval or Ratio data observations", answer = "data must be reasonably normally distributed",  "groups should each have equal variance", "data observations must be unrelated", "predicting factors must be divided into separate groups"))` |

Take a look at your lecture notes from week 8!

:::
:::

It is very straighforward to check these assumptions in Jamovi - find the 'Assumption Checks' menu and select all three options to run the Shapiro-Wilk test, Levene's Test and the QQ plot.

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - is the assumption of independence met?

Yes, this is a between subjects design in which each participant only contributes a single data point to this study. ANOVA analysis for repeated measures designs are possible - you might encounter these in a future module.

:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - is the assumption of homogeneity of variance met?

No, Levene's test is significant indicating that the groups do not have equal variance.

We can explore this further by running descriptive statistics on the groups. We can see that the standard deviation of the `Reactivation+Tetris` group looks to be much smaller than the others. This is likely where the difference is coming from.

:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - is the for normally distributed data met?

No, Shapiro-Wilk's test is significant indicating that the data is not normally distributed. This is confirmed by the QQ plot in which the top end of the data depart from the centre diagonal line.

The estimated marginal means plot from your earlier analysis can help explain why this is. Notice that the data points in that plot have a positive skew - ie a small number of participants seem to have a lot of intrusive memories.

:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - is the assumption of categorical factors met?

Yes, our `Conditions` variable is categorical. It contains our four groups without any implied order.

:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - is the assumed data type correct?

Yes, our `Days_One_to_Seven_Image_Based_Intrusions_in_Intrusion_Diary` variable is ratio data. It contains numerical data in which zero means an absence of intrusive memories.

## 7. ANOVA on log transformed data {.unnumbered}

Looks like our data do not meet the parametric assumptions of a standard ANOVA analysis. Its often a good idea to check assumptions early in the data analysis process...

There are non-parametric ANOVA analyses available - you could now run the Kruskall Wallis test on the data to perform a non parametric one way ANOVA.

Let's try a data transformation here though, the full parametric ANOVA is very flexible so it would be good to use it if we can.

## 8. Summary {.unnumbered}

ANOVA is a flexible and powerful method for comparing the means of more than two groups whilst accounting for the exploding number of multiple comparisons we get from more complex experimental designs. ANOVA takes a bit more work to run, check and interpret than a t-test but the results from a single ANOVA analysis contain a huge amount of critical information about our data!
