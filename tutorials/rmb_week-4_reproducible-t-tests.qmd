## 6. Compute Descriptive Statistics with R in Rj {.unnumbered}

Ok, back to statistics! How can we use our new R skills to compute statistics?

The trick is to understand that all the analyses in Jamovi are actually carried out by functions in R. Each analysis we can select from the top ribbon in Jamovi corresponds to a function that can be called in the code. Similarly, all of the options that we select in the analysis, dialogue boxes, correspond to arguments for that function. Let's take a look in practice.

To help understand this Jamovi provides an “R Syntax Mode”, in this mode, Jamovi produces equivalent R code for each analysis. To change to syntax mode, select the application menu (⋮) at the top right of Jamovi, and check the Syntax mode checkbox there. You can find more information on [Jamovi's documentation on Syntax Mode](https://docs.jamovi.org/_pages/um_6_syntax_mode.html).


Notice that some R code has appeared at the top of the output table. This is relatively complex compared to our previous functions like `print` or `sqrt`. Let's break it down a bit.

## Data Skills - Understanding the descriptives function

This is the code that Jamovi's syntax mode will produce (with a little formatting to make the appearance simpler). Take a look through each part to understand what it does. Click the number in the annotation to highlight the corresponding part of the code.

``` r
jmv::descriptives(                                                                      # <1>
    data = data,                                                                        # <2>
    vars = vars(Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism)  # <3>
    )
```

1.  This is the name of the function that will do the computation for us. Everything contained within these parentheses are known as arguments, or inputs, for the function
2.  The first input is named `data` and is assigned to be the special data variable that contains the data loaded into our spreadsheet.
3.  The second input is a list of the data columns in our spreadsheet that we want to compute descriptives from.

There is a lot of information here that might be hard to understand at first. Try changing the analysis options using the Jamovi buttons and watch what happens to the R syntax. In particular, try adding and removing different variables to the analysis.

# Key step

Once you're ready, you can right click on this R syntax and click ‘Copy’ to copy it to your clipboard.

and pasting it into an Rj window - now you can click run to reproduce your descriptive statistics table using the underlying R code.

Great - well done on completing your first data analysis using R code! You should have the following output that will match the descriptives you've seen in the main Jamovi window.

Head back over to the Jamovi descriptives tab and try updating your analysis. You could change the variables that you are computing the descriptive statistics from, add in some extra metrics (such as the Skewness or Shapiro-Wilk) or even generate a plot like a histogram.

Note that the R code in the syntax box of the output will stay up to date with your changes. Pay attention to how the function updates when you select different options.

## Question

What is the R code required to compute descriptive statistics from the Openness and Conscientiousness variables, whilst including the Skewness metric, the Shapiro-Wilk statistic and a histogram?

Can you run this analysis in Rj?

## Hint

Remember that the R code in the syntax mode will update as you define your analysis in Jamovi. Get the analysis right there and you can simply copy over the code.

Talk to your tutor if you're getting stuck.

## Solution

The final code should look like this

``` r
jmv::descriptives(
    data = data,
    vars = vars(Openness, Conscientiousness),
    hist = TRUE,
    skew = TRUE,
    sw = TRUE)
```
