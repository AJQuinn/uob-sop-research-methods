# Week 3 : One-Sample t-tests {.unnumbered}

This week we will explore how to use Jamovi to compute and visualise descriptive statistics from a dataset. This will include some revision on Jamovi from last semester and an introduction on how we can use the R coding language to simplify complex data processing.

## 1. The Dataset {.unnumbered}

Metaphors are often used to help people understand abstract concepts in terms of perceptual experiences. Though this is often useful, it can bias perception and decision making in unexpected ways. For example, North and South are abstract concepts that have a spatial association (north = up, south = down). Participants in the USA have a biased expectation that richer people will live in the north of a city [@Meier2011_Spatial]. However, these expectations are not uniform across all people and cultures and we should not naively generalise this result to all people. A follow up study comparing this effect in participants from the USA and Hong Kong replicated the original effect for American participants but found the opposite effect in people from Hong Kong [@Huang2014_Living].

The Many Labs 2 project [@Klein2018_ManyLabs2] performed an additional replication of this effect across a wide range of countries. Participants were presented with the following map outline of a city:

![](../images/rmb-2025_week-3_computer-practical/RMB-2025_week-3_img1.png){width="500px"}

and asked to indicate where they though a fictional person would live within the city. Participants were shown one of two descriptions of the person.

> “Dr. Bennett lives in the city. He is a wealthy businessman who has travelled the world. He inherited a significant amount of money from a Great Aunt, and was educated at the best schools growing up. He enjoys fine dining and going to the theater on weekends.”

Or

> “Mr. Bennett lives in the city. He is unemployed. He was born and raised in the city he now calls home. He struggles to pay the rent each month, and dropped out of high school before graduation. He enjoys a good hot dog and a six pack of beers when he can.”

The first description is a caricature of a person with high Socio-Economic Status (SES) whilst the second is a caricature of someone with a low SES. The hypothesis is that people in the United States and Hong Kong have different demographic knowledge that may shape their metaphoric link between positive association and cardinal direction (north vs. south).

## 2. The Challenge {.unnumbered}

This week we will use one-sample t-tests to explore whether participants from the UK would expect people with low or high SES to live north or south of the centre of the city.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
# A new hypothesis?

Before we start, think about what you would predict about participants from the UK. Is there a reason to expect that people in the UK would associate the north of a city with high SES or vice versa?

Note that there isn’t necessarily a correct answer to this question but it is good practice to be clear about our predictions and expectations before starting a data analysis.

## 3. Getting started with descriptive Statistics {.unnumbered}

Let's start by loading the dataset into Jamovi and checking out the data. You can use the file named `RMB-2024_computer-practical_huang-2014_country-UK_cond-All.csv`.

This dataset has several columns of data. The main column of interest is currently named `variable`. This represents the y-axis position of the persons expectation about where the fictional character would live. A value of zero represents the middle of the city, positive values represent more northern locations and negative values represent more southern locations.

The other key variable is named `factor`. This indicates which group the participant was allocated to. This can be either 'high' or 'low' depending on whether the participant saw a description of a person with stereotypes of high or low socioeconomic status.

This is open-access data and the column names aren't very informative. It would be better to rename them to something more considered so that we can avoid mistakes later.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
# Key step

Rename the following variables using the editor under the 'Variables' tab.

-   'variable' should be renamed to 'NorthSouth_Position', and
-   'factor' should be renamed to 'SES_Story'.

Don't include any spaces in the new variable names! this can cause an issue later.

Next, take a look through the data itself. Remember the steps we took in the last couple of weeks. Have a careful scan through the data values and see if you can spot anything that needs to be fixed.

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - how many participants are included in the dataset?

We have 136 rows of data observations the spreadsheet.
:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - what experimental design was used in this experiment?

This is a between-subjects design, though that might not be obvious from the data alone! Checking through the paper methods we can see that each participant was either in the high or low SES condition.
:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - do we need to tidy up this dataset?

No, in this case the dataset looks very clean. We appear to have data for everyone without any obvious typos or missing information. Looks good to go.
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
# Key step

Compute some descriptive statistics on the `NorthSouth` column. Make sure that you include the standard error of the mean!

You can split the descriptive statistics using a second variable. This

:::

Next, let's think about what these values can tell us.

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - do we have an equal number of data points in each condition?

No, we have 75 participants in the High condition and 61 participants in the Low condition.
:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - which condition has a wider variation in NorthSouth Positions chosen by participants?

We can see this from the standard deviations. The High condition has a standard deviation of 63.2 and the Low condition has a standard deviation of 77.8.

The responses in the Low SES story condition were more variable.
:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - which condition has a more northern mean position?

Recall from the introduction that positive values indicate a position in the north of the city. The High condition has a mean value of -39.0 and the Low condition has a mean value of 18.6

The responses in the Low SES story condition were more northern.
:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - can we tell from the descriptives whether this is a significant difference?

No! remember that descriptive statistics only summarise the data as it is. They cannot tell us whether we would expect what we see in that data to generalise beyond the specific data sample.

## 4. Data filters in Jamovi {.unnumbered}

Next, we're going to ask whether the participants in the either the High or Low SES conditions had a preference towards locating our fictional character in the North or South of the city. This is our one-sample t-test. The `NorthSouth_Position` is our data variable and the centre point of the city is the comparison value.

First, we need to split out the data so that we can run the t-test using either the Low or High SES conditions, not using both mixed together.

We can do this in Jamovi using a 'Filter'. Jamovi provides some great [documentation on data filters](https://blog.jamovi.org/2018/04/25/jamovi-filters.html) on their website. Take a few minutes and read through the info on 'Row Filters' on this page.

The most important thing about filters is that they are reversible. We can apply a filter to run an analysis on a subset of the data without actually changing the dataset itself. This means we could make several different filters and turn them on and off to repeat the same analyses on different sections of the dataset. Convenient!


::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
# Key step

Following the guidance on the Jamovi [documentation on data filters](https://blog.jamovi.org/2018/04/25/jamovi-filters.html), create a filter to select ONLY the participants who heard the low SES story.

The result should exclude the first 75 rows from your dataset, you can confirm this by looking at the ticks and crosses in the 'Filter' column, and by inspecting the values in the very bottom of the window.

![](../images/rmb-2025_week-3_computer-practical/RMB-2025_week-3_img4.png)
:::


Note that your analyses in results windows will automatically update when you apply a filter to the data. With the filter applied, you will only see the descriptive statistics for the 'Low' SES_Story groups.

If you click the 'active' toggle in the 'Filter' window you can turn the filter off and your analysis will return to its initial state.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
# Key step

With your first Filter turned OFF, create a filter to select ONLY the participants who heard the High SES story.

The result should now exclude the last 61 rows from your dataset.

![](../images/rmb-2025_week-3_computer-practical/RMB-2025_week-3_img5.png)
You can turn your filters on and off to see how this changes the data available for the analysis, though turning both filters on will exclude all the data in this case...

## 5. One-Sample T-tests {.unnumbered}

Now we're ready to test our hypothesis!

$$
t = \frac{\text{The sample mean} - \text{Comparison Value}}{\text{The standard error of the mean}}
$$

In this case we want to compare our mean to the middle of the city which has a value of zero.

We have both of these values above. Can you compute the value of our t-test using a calculator?

<!--# #############################################  -->

:::: callout-tip
## Check Your Understanding

::: panel-tabset
## Question

Can you compute the t-value for the High SES Story group?

## Hint

First, get the three values that you'll need for the computation. These are the comparison value and the mean and standard error of the mean for the High SES group.

## Solution

The individual values are

-   Group Mean =
-   Comparison Value = 0
-   Standard error of the mean =

so the t-value is

$$
t = \frac{xyz - 0}{sem} = 234
$$

## 6. Reproducible One-Sample T-tests {.unnumbered}

Recall that the equation for a one-sample t-test is a fraction with the difference between the mean and our comparison value on the top and the standard error of the mean on the bottom.
