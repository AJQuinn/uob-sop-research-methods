# Week 3 : One-Sample t-tests {.unnumbered}

This week we will explore how to use Jamovi to compute and visualise descriptive statistics from a dataset. This will include some revision on Jamovi from last semester and an introduction on how we can use the R coding language to simplify complex data processing.

## 1. The Dataset {.unnumbered}

Metaphors are often used to help people understand abstract concepts in terms of perceptual experiences. Though this is often useful, it can bias perception and decision making in unexpected ways. For example, North and South are abstract concepts that have a spatial association (north = up, south = down). Participants in the USA have a biased expectation that richer people will live in the north of a city [@Meier2011_Spatial]. However, these expectations are not uniform across all people and cultures and we should not naively generalise this result to all people. A follow up study comparing this effect in participants from the USA and Hong Kong replicated the original effect for American participants but found the opposite effect in people from Hong Kong [@Huang2014_Living].

The Many Labs 2 project [@Klein2018_ManyLabs2] performed an additional replication of this effect across a wide range of countries. Participants were presented with the following map outline of a city:

![](../images/rmb-2025_week-3_computer-practical/RMB-2025_week-3_img1.png){width="500px"}

and asked to indicate where they though a fictional person would live within the city. Participants were shown one of two descriptions of the person.

> “Dr. Bennett lives in the city. He is a wealthy businessman who has travelled the world. He inherited a significant amount of money from a Great Aunt, and was educated at the best schools growing up. He enjoys fine dining and going to the theater on weekends.”

Or

> “Mr. Bennett lives in the city. He is unemployed. He was born and raised in the city he now calls home. He struggles to pay the rent each month, and dropped out of high school before graduation. He enjoys a good hot dog and a six pack of beers when he can.”

The first description is a caricature of a person with high Socio-Economic Status (SES) whilst the second is a caricature of someone with a low SES. The hypothesis is that people in the United States and Hong Kong have different demographic knowledge that may shape their metaphoric link between positive association and cardinal direction (north vs. south).

## 2. The Challenge {.unnumbered}

This week we will use one-sample t-tests to explore whether participants from the UK would expect people with low or high SES to live north or south of the centre of the city.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
# A new hypothesis?

Before we start, think about what you would predict about participants from the UK. Is there a reason to expect that people in the UK would associate the north of a city with high SES or vice versa?

Make a note of your answer and the reasons behind it. Note that there isn’t necessarily a correct answer to this question and we won't ask you for it later.

It is good practice to be clear about our predictions and expectations before starting a data analysis.

:::

## 3. Getting started with descriptive Statistics {.unnumbered}

Let's start by loading the dataset into Jamovi and checking out the data. You can use the file named `RMB-2024_computer-practical_huang-2014_country-UK_cond-All.csv`.

This dataset has several columns of data. The main column of interest is currently named `variable`. This represents the y-axis position of the persons expectation about where the fictional character would live. A value of zero represents the middle of the city, positive values represent more northern locations and negative values represent more southern locations.

The other key variable is named `factor`. This indicates which group the participant was allocated to. This can be either 'high' or 'low' depending on whether the participant saw a description of a person with stereotypes of high or low socioeconomic status.

This is open-access data and the column names aren't very informative. It would be better to rename them to something more considered so that we can avoid mistakes later.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
# Key step

Rename the following variables using the editor under the 'Variables' tab.

-   'variable' should be renamed to 'NorthSouth_Position', and
-   'factor' should be renamed to 'SES_Story'.

Don't include any spaces in the new variable names! this can cause an issue later.

![](../images/rmb-2025_week-3_computer-practical/RMB-2025_week-3_img2.png)
:::

Next, take a look through the data itself. Remember the steps we took in the last couple of weeks. Have a careful scan through the data values and see if you can spot anything that needs to be fixed.

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - how many participants are included in the dataset?

We have 136 rows of data observations the spreadsheet.
:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - what experimental design was used in this experiment?

This is a between-subjects design, though that might not be obvious from the data alone! Checking through the paper methods we can see that each participant was either in the high or low SES condition.
:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - do we need to tidy up this dataset?

No, in this case the dataset looks very clean. We appear to have data for everyone without any obvious typos or missing information. Looks good to go.
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
# Key step

Compute some descriptive statistics on the `NorthSouth` column. Make sure that you include the standard error of the mean!

You can split the descriptive statistics using a second variable. We can do this by adding the variables we want to describe to the 'Variables' section and including a categorical variable in the 'Split by' section (we can only split data into categories, it wouldn't make sense to try and split data into a continuous variable)

Split your descriptive statistics by the `SES_Story` variable.

![](../images/rmb-2025_week-3_computer-practical/RMB-2025_week-3_img3.png)
:::

Next, let's think about what these values can tell us.

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - do we have an equal number of data points in each condition?

No, we have 75 participants in the High condition and 61 participants in the Low condition.
:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - which condition has a wider variation in NorthSouth Positions chosen by participants?

We can see this from the standard deviations. The High condition has a standard deviation of 63.2 and the Low condition has a standard deviation of 77.8.

The responses in the Low SES story condition were more variable.
:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - which condition has a more northern mean position?

Recall from the introduction that positive values indicate a position in the north of the city. The High condition has a mean value of -39.0 and the Low condition has a mean value of 18.6

The responses in the Low SES story condition were more northern.
:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - can we tell from the descriptives whether this is a significant difference?

No! remember that descriptive statistics only summarise the data as it is. They cannot tell us whether we would expect what we see in that data to generalise beyond the specific data sample.
:::


::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - are we more confident in our estimate of the mean for the 'North' or 'South' condition?

The standard error of the mean tells us how well we think our estimated mean from the data sample represents the 'true' population mean.

The standard error of the mean for the 'Low' group is higher (9.96 vs 7.3 for 'High') - indicating that we are less confident that this is a good representation of our population mean. Note that it could still be a good estimate, we're just relatively less confident than we are for the 'High' condition.

:::

## 4. Data filters in Jamovi {.unnumbered}

Next, we're going to ask whether the participants in the either the High or Low SES conditions had a preference towards locating our fictional character in the North or South of the city. This is our one-sample t-test. The `NorthSouth_Position` is our data variable and the centre point of the city is the comparison value.

First, we need to split out the data so that we can run the t-test using either the Low or High SES conditions, not using both mixed together.

We can do this in Jamovi using a 'Filter'. Jamovi provides some great [documentation on data filters](https://blog.jamovi.org/2018/04/25/jamovi-filters.html) on their website. Take a few minutes and read through the info on 'Row Filters' on this page.

The most important thing about filters is that they are reversible. We can apply a filter to run an analysis on a subset of the data without actually changing the dataset itself. This means we could make several different filters and turn them on and off to repeat the same analyses on different sections of the dataset. Convenient!


::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
# Key step

Following the guidance on the Jamovi [documentation on data filters](https://blog.jamovi.org/2018/04/25/jamovi-filters.html), create a filter to select ONLY the participants who heard the low SES story.

The result should exclude the first 75 rows from your dataset, you can confirm this by looking at the ticks and crosses in the 'Filter' column, and by inspecting the values in the very bottom of the window.

![](../images/rmb-2025_week-3_computer-practical/RMB-2025_week-3_img4.png)
:::


Note that your analyses in results windows will automatically update when you apply a filter to the data. With the filter applied, you will only see the descriptive statistics for the 'Low' SES_Story groups.

If you click the 'active' toggle in the 'Filter' window you can turn the filter off and your analysis will return to its initial state.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
# Key step

With your first Filter turned OFF, create a filter to select ONLY the participants who heard the High SES story.

The result should now exclude the last 61 rows from your dataset.

![](../images/rmb-2025_week-3_computer-practical/RMB-2025_week-3_img5.png)
You can turn your filters on and off to see how this changes the data available for the analysis, though turning both filters on will exclude all the data in this case...

:::

## 5. One-Sample T-tests {.unnumbered}

Now we're ready to test our hypothesis! remember that the equation for a one-sample t-test is the following:

$$
t = \frac{\text{The sample mean} - \text{Comparison Value}}{\text{The standard error of the mean}}
$$

We're looking at the difference between our observed mean and a comparison value as a ratio to the precision to which we have estimated our observed mean.

Our descriptive statistics output contains the  mean and standard error of the mean for both groups. Our comparison value is the centre of the city, indicated by a score of `0` (zero).

We all the values required for a one-sample t-test already in the descriptive statistics! For the 'Low' SES_Story condition, we have:

-   Group Mean = 18.6
-   Comparison Value = 0
-   Standard error of the mean = 9.96

So, the one sample t-test value is:

$$
t = \frac{18.6 - 0}{9.96} = 1.867
$$

## Check Your Understanding

::: panel-tabset
## Question

Can you compute the t-value for the High SES Story group using a calculator or Rj?

## Hint

First, get the three values that you'll need for the computation. These are the comparison value and the mean and standard error of the mean for the High SES group.

## Solution

The individual values are

-   Group Mean = -39.0
-   Comparison Value = 0
-   Standard error of the mean = 7.30

so the t-value is

$$
t = \frac{-39.0 - 0}{7.30} = -5.342
$$

## 6.  One Sample T-tests in Jamovi {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
# Key step

Before going any further - make sure that your data filter is set to include **only** the data from the 'Low' SES_Story condition.

:::

Of course, we will normally compute the t-test using Jamovi as rather than relying on hand calculations. We can do this by opening the 'One Sample T-Test' option under the 'Analysis -> T-Tests' menu on the top ribbon.

Open the One Sample T-Test option now, and drag the `NorthSouth_Position` variable over to the 'dependent variables' box. The result should appear on the right hand side. Before we inspect the result, we should check and add a number of important options to our analysis.

![](../images/rmb-2025_week-3_computer-practical/RMB-2025_week-3_img6_crop.png){width=450px}


- **Hypothesis - test value** it is critical that we select the correct hypothesis or our test will be meaningless. Our 'test value', also known as a 'comparison value', is set to zero by default. This is correct for our analysis but may need setting to something else for other analyses. Take care to check it makes sense each time.

- **Hypothesis - test tail** we can also specify whether we're going to perform a one- or two-tailed test. Here we want to specify a two-tailed test in which the mean does not equal the test value.

- **Assumption Checks** we should add a test to check that our data are normally distributed. Selecting the 'Normality test' box will compute a Shapio-Wilks statistic for you

- **Additional Statistics** there are a number of important options here. For now, add the 'Descriptive plots' option to your analysis. This will show us a visualisation of the estimated mean and its confidence intervals.


Let's take a look at the outputs, first the t-test table.

![](../images/rmb-2025_week-3_computer-practical/RMB-2025_week-3_img6_ttable.png){width=450px}

This contains the information we need to report our t-test: the t-value, the degrees of freedom and the p-value.

> t(60) = 1.87, p = 0.066

This t-value should match the number you computed by hand earlier on. Note that the footnote of the table reminds us of the hypothesis that we specified. Make sure that this matches what you expect!

Next, the normality check:

![](../images/rmb-2025_week-3_computer-practical/RMB-2025_week-3_img6_normaltable.png){width=450px}

This reports the Shapiro-Wilk W statistic and associated p-value. In this case the p-value is not significant which indicates that the data are normally distributed and we're happy to go ahead with the parametric t-test.

Next, the descriptives plot:

![](../images/rmb-2025_week-3_computer-practical/RMB-2025_week-3_img6_descriptiveplot.png){width=450px}

This is a really useful visualisation of our test. We can see the mean of the data (black dot) and the test value (dotted line). We also have the 95% confidence intervals of the estimated mean. We can see that the confidence intervals overlap with the test value - this tells us that it is likely our test will not be significant - according to our confidence intervals, the true population mean might include our test value zero which would indicate no real difference.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
# Key step

Change your data filter to compute the one-sample t-test for the 'High' SES_Story condition. The test should update once your filter is on without you having to respecify the test.

:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - Is the mean position of participants in the 'High' condition significantly different to zero?

Yes, we do have a significant difference - we could report our test as follows

> t(74) = -5.35, p < 0.001

:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - Is it valid to use parametric statistics on this data?

The Shapiro Wilk statistic has a p-value of 0.038 which is less than p = 0.05. This suggets that our data are not normally distributed. We should inspect the data in more detail and consider using a non-parametric alternative.

The Wilcoxon Rank test is the non-parametric alternative for One Sample t-test. You can add this to the analysis to see if it gives the same result as the parametric test.

:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - Do the confidence intervals of the estimated mean cross zero?

No - in the 'High' condition the confidence intervals of the mean are a long way from zero.

:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
# Key step

Go back to your notes from the start of the session. Do the results match your predictions about whether a UK data sample would expect a high or low socio-economic status people to live in the north or south of the city?

:::

<!--# #############################################  -->

## 7. Reproducible One-Sample T-tests {.unnumbered}

Finally - we should make a reproducible version of our analysis using Rj.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
# Key step

Open a new Rj window and add the following line to load the `dplyr` library.

``` r
library(dplyr)
```

:::

Firstly, we'll need to replicate our data filter to select only the 'High' or 'Low' conditions for our analysis. We covered this in detail last week - if you need a refresher, take a look at the information on [selecting rows of data using the filter function from week 2](../tutorials/rmb_week-2_intro-to-Rj.qmd#selecting-rows-of-data-using-the-filter-function)

Let's build a filter to select only the 'High' condition.

``` r
library(dplyr)

high_ses <- filter(data, SES_Story == 'High')
```

Next - turn on Jamovi's [syntax mode](https://docs.jamovi.org/_pages/um_6_syntax_mode.html) to display the R code associated with our analyses. This should create some R code at the top of each results block.

![](../images/rmb-2025_week-3_computer-practical/RMB-2025_week-3_img8.png){width=450px}

We can right click on this code to copy it before pasting it into the Rj window. Our code should then look like this:

``` r
library(dplyr)

high_ses <- filter(data, SES_Story == 'High')

jmv::ttestOneS(
    data = data,
    vars = NorthSouth_Position,
    norm = TRUE,
    plots = TRUE)

```

::: {.callout-warning}
Some people have encountered an issue with running this code block - if your R session stalls whilst running the code above, please try again whilst removing `plots=TRUE`.

Apologies - we're working on a fix for this.
:::

This command runs the function `ttestOneS` which computes the One Sample t-test. Jamovi has automatically detected that we want to add the normality test and the descriptive plots and included these options in the function call (see `norm=TRUE` and `plots=TRUE`).

There is a keyword argument in R for every option in Jamovi - take a look at the `jmv` library documentation for [ttestOneS](https://www.jamovi.org/jmv/ttestones.html) to see a full list.

Before running the code we need to make one adjustment. The function runs on the full dataset `data` by default but we want to use our new filtered data `high_ses` instead. Update the function to take in the filtered data as an input.


``` r
library(dplyr)

high_ses <- filter(data, SES_Story == 'High')

jmv::ttestOneS(
    data = high_ses,
    vars = NorthSouth_Position,
    norm = TRUE,
    plots = TRUE)

```

Now running the code should output result tables that match our previous analysis. Importantly the form of data preprocessing (the filtering) and the test itself are all clearly specified in the code. Making it easier for others to understand what analysis we have run.



<!--# #############################################  -->

:::: callout-tip
## Check Your Understanding

::: panel-tabset
## Question

Can you add a code block to compute the one-sample t-test for only the 'Low' SES_Story condition

## Hint

Remember that you'll need to write a new filter line to create a copy of the dataset with only the 'Low' values for SES_Story. You can save this into a variable and pass it in as the data argument to `ttestOneS`

## Solution

Your final code should look like this:

```R
low_ses <- filter(data, SES_Story == 'Low')

jmv::ttestOneS(
    data = low_ses,
    vars = NorthSouth_Position,
    norm = TRUE,
    plots = TRUE)
```

:::
::::

You can keep adding R code to your script to run multiple analyses at once, this way we can run the t-test for both conditions with out having to go back and forth in Jamovi toggling the data filters on and off.

It takes a little more setup but the R code has some big advantages once you get used to it!

## 8. Summary {.unnumbered}

We've done a lot of work to consolidate our skills on filtering data and computing one sample t-tests! You should now be able to compute these tests in Jamovi and create reproducible R code.
