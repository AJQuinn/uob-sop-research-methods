# Week 8 : Introduction to Jamovi {.unnumbered}

This week you will be introduced to Jamovi. You will use Jamovi throughout your degree for statistical analysis, so it is very important to get familiar with it! 

JAMOVI has inbuilt functions which can be used to investigate and manipulate data, and to perform majority of statistical tests used in psychological research. Each task you perform in JAMOVI will generate an output which will support your research decisions, such as choosing a statistical test or deciding whether to reject a hypothesis.

JAMOVI will already be on the computers on Campus but if you want to use it at home too you will need to download and install it on to your personal laptop or desktop PC. The software is free and we recommend that you install it at home because you will need to use it a lot over the next three years, including for many of your assignments. As you can see on the JAMOVI website, there are versions for WindowsOS, MacOS and ChromeOS:  <https://www.jamovi.org/download.html> 
 
You can find instructions for how to install JAMOVI on your personal laptop or desktop PC here: <https://docs.jamovi.org/_pages/um_1_installation.html>

There is also a Cloud version here: <https://www.jamovi.org/cloud.html>

You will also be able to find a lot of information about how to use JAMOVI on their website and all of this is free to access. You should explore their website but this page could be particularly useful because it is a comprehensive User Guide: <https://www.jamovi.org/user-manual.html>

# Today's session

Today you will just be familiarising yourself with the Jamovi interface and its layout / basic functions. Next week we will move on to using Jamovi for statistical analysis of data – so make sure you are comfortable with the layout and using the basic functions this week!
:::

## 1. The Dataset {.unnumbered}

We will be exploring the dataset *employees data* that you can find on the CANVAS page under **Week 8** of the computer labs folder of **Research Methods A**

## 2. The Challenge {.unnumbered}

We have a dataset of employees in a big data table. This raw data needs to be summarised and visualised so that we can turn this massive block of numbers into something intuitive. 

We can generate a concise overview of the main characteristics of the data by computing and visualising a few key features from the data. 

::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple"}
# Opening Jamovi

We'll be working with Jamovi throughout this practical. 

**Working on campus?** You can open Jamovi through AppsAnywhere, either open the desktop application through the start menu on a campus computer or [Birmingham's AppsAnywhere website](https://apps.bham.ac.uk/).

Take a look at these [frequently asked questions](frequently-asked-questions.qmd) or ask your tutor if you get stuck.

**Working on your own computer?** You can [install Jamovi (for free!) folling these instructions](https://www.jamovi.org/). Install the 'Desktop' application - not the 'Cloud' version.

:::

## 3. Jamovi Basics {.unnumbered}

The instructions for installing and licensing JAMOVI on your personal computer are available above. To access JAMOVI once installed or when using Campus computers you will be able to find it in the start menu at the bottom left corner of your desktop (sometimes this will be in another location on your personal laptop or personal desktop PC – you know your device best!) 

Once open, you will see the following screen. Note that if you are working with a later version of JAMOVI, the screen may look a little different e.g. in version ‘2.3.28 solid’ there is a tab called “Variables” before “Data” at the top of the screen. As researchers we work with statistical software which updates occasionally. Most of the changes are often cosmetic but sometimes options and functions move or are improved. You should be prepared to familiarise yourself with the changes each time they happen and JAMOVI update their user guides regularly to account for updates.

## 4. How to open an excel file in Jamovi {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
# Key step

Let's start by loading the dataset into Jamovi. You can download the file `Employees data.xlsx` from canvas.

In Jamovi, click the 3 horizontal lines in the top left corner, click file, and click open. Find your data file and click to open. 

![](../images/rma-2025_week-8_computer-practical/RMA-2025_week-8_computer-practical_img3.png){width="600px"}

Click on the data tab and then on set-up to see the variable information

![](../images/rma-2025_week-8_computer-practical/RMA-2025_week-8_computer-practical_img4.png){width="600px"}

Try clicking on different column names to change the information you are presented with. 

![](../images/rma-2025_week-8_computer-practical/RMA-2025_week-8_computer-practical_img5.png){width="600px"}

Try changing the labels for gender from 0 and 1 to something meaningful.

## 6. Exercises
Now it is time for you to explore the data. If you are unsure about any of these, please talk to the staff in your computer practical session. 

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - What do each row and column represent?

The rows represent participants and the columns represent the different variables 
:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - How many variables are there in this data set?

There are 8 variables in this data set
:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - What are the variables called?

The variable are called gender, bdate, educ, jobcat, salary, salbegin, prevexp, minority
:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - How many levels are there to each variable?

Gender: 2
Educ: 
Jobcat: 3
Minority: 2

Only the variables that are categorical have levels as these are the only variables that represent groups. 
:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Ethical Consideration - How could you ask a question about gender identity in a more inclusive way? 

You could ask participants to state their gender without putting constraints on this. 
You could ask what gender participants identify as
:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - What type of variables (ordinal, scale (continuous), nominal) are there in the dataset?

Gender: Nominal

Bdate: ID

Educ: Nominal

Jobcat: Nominal

Salary: Scale (continuous)

Salbegin: Scale (continuous)

Prevexp: Scale (continuous)

Minority: Nominal


:::

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - Your variables are not always imported as the correct variable type. In this case Bdate has been imported as ID which isn't one of our variable types. What should you change this to? 

Nominal 

Please change this on your dataset.

# Note

When conducting statistical analysis for your research, you need to ensure that your variables are set to the right type. Otherwise, your analysis may not work correctly. 
:::


::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - What does the variable 'Minority' mean? Is it useful? Is there any information in the dataset to tell us what the numbers mean? 

The variable gives us information about whether the participant is part of a minority group. 
It isn't very useful without labels. 
There is no information in the dataset that would allow us to discern what the numbers mean either. 

:::

Please add labels to your 'Minority' variable where 0 = Not a minority and 1 = Minority

For the next few exercises you need to run some short analysis to get some descriptive statistics. Go to Analyse -> Exploration -> Descriptive statistics. Put Education and Job Category into the right-hand box.  See the results appear in the right-hand window.

![](../images/rma-2025_week-8_computer-practical/RMA-2025_week-8_computer-practical_img8.png){width="600px"}


Now try putting gender in the 'split by' box and see what happens to the output

![](../images/rma-2025_week-8_computer-practical/RMA-2025_week-8_computer-practical_img10.png){width="600px"}

Add labels to the variable JobCat where 1 = Manual, 2 = Office and 3 = Corporate. 
Go to Analyse -> Exploration -> Descriptive statistics. Put Salary into the right-hand box and Press OK. Look at the output 

![](../images/rma-2025_week-8_computer-practical/RMA-2025_week-8_computer-practical_img11.png){width="600px"}

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - What is the mean salary?

34420
:::

Now do the same again but split by JobCat.

![](../images/rma-2025_week-8_computer-practical/RMA-2025_week-8_computer-practical_img12.png){width="600px"}


::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## <i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> Data Skills - What are the mean salaries for each group?

Group 1: 27839
Group 2: 30939
Group 3: 63978
:::


On the same screen click 'plot' and then tick the box for histogram and bar plot. You'll see the graphs appear in the screen to the right. Have a play around with the different options and see what you can produce.
