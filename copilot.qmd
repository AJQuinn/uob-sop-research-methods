# Using Copilot at University of Birmingham

Microsoft Copilot is now available to use for University of Birmingham members. See the [University documentation pages to get access](https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/student/news/public/oct-dec-2024/microsoft-copilot-genai-now-available-for-students.aspx)

You are welcome to use Copilot to support your learning of statistics and coding throughout the Research Methods B computer practical sessions. In particular, Copilot can be a useful way to get a second perspective on different technical concepts, to help generate data analysis code or to understand where data analysis code might have gone wrong.

Throughout the course - we will suggest places where you might benefit from interacting with Copilot to support your learning. Look out for dialogue boxes like this one.

## Check Your Understanding with Copilot (Optional)

Try asking Copilot for more information about `variables` in R. We suggest you try the following prompts to get started.

- "Write a simple description of variables in R for a beginner"
- "How can I choose a name for my variable in R"

Make sure to ask follow up questions if you would like more information. Remember to talk with your session tutors if you get stuck.

## Ethical use of Copilot

Tools like Copilot can be a valuable learning aid, however it is critical that you familiarise yourself with the [Universityâ€™s student and PGR guidance on using GenAI tools ethically for work](https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/student/libraries/asc/student-guidance-gai.aspx). This guidance provides you with the risks and limitations of using Generative AI tools in your academic study

It is not permitted to use Generative AI tools in assessment unless explicitly stated on the assessment page. It is your responsibility to use these tools in an appropriate way.
